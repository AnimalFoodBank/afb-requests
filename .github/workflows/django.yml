# This is a basic GitHub Actions workflow for running CI tests on a Django project.
# It runs on Ubuntu 22.04 with 4 parallel jobs, caches system packages and Python dependencies,
# and checks out the repository with a fetch depth of 1. The build job sets the Python version to 3.10
# and runs the tests using the specified matrix. It is triggered on push or pull request events on the main branch,
# as well as manually using the workflow_dispatch event.
# For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-python#building-and-testing-python-with-multiple-versions
