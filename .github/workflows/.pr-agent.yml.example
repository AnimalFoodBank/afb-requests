#
# This code snippet is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration
# file. It defines a workflow that runs on pull requests and
# issue comments events. The workflow consists of a single job
# called "pr_agent_job" that runs on the latest version of
# Ubuntu. The job has permissions to write to issues, pull
# requests, and contents.
#
# The job includes a step called "PR Agent action step" that
# uses the "Codium-ai/pr-agent" action. This action is
# responsible for running the PR Agent on every pull request
# and responding to user comments. It requires the
# "OPENAI_KEY" environment variable to be set, which is
# retrieved from the "secrets.OPENAI_KEY" secret.
#
# Please note that this is just a code snippet and should be
# integrated into a complete GitHub Actions workflow file.
